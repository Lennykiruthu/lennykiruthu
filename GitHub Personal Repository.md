Hello friend
I'm Lenny and I like problems that's why I decided to solve as many as possible using mathematics, statistics, programming and the resilience to learn daily. Check out my repositories to see what I'm publicly working on. I'm also working on private competitions and will make those public when the competitions close.
Check out my socials for more information.
