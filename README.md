 ## 👋 Hello, friend!

- I'm **Lenny**, a problem-solver who enjoys tackling real-world challenges using **mathematics**, **statistics**, and **programming** — all driven by a relentless curiosity and a habit of learning every day.
- 🔍 Check out my repositories to see what I’m currently building in public.  
   I'm also active in private data science competitions — those projects will be made public once the challenges end.
- Let's connect.
